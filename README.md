About tikzrput package:
This package contains the rput macro that can be used to place objects. This macro does similar actions of the rput macro from pstricks. Here this macro needs tikz to work.
With this new version comes a new family of ornaments.
Chennan Zhang drew the motifs using a CAD application, re-drew them in TikZ, and granted permission for these to be turned into a library pgfornament-han suitable for use with the pgfornament package by LianTze Lim.
It is now possible to use directly the library for Chinese traditional motifs and patterns.
